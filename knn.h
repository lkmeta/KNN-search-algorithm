 * Input:
 *      knnresult old: struct containing the first list to be merged (updated list is stored to this one)
 *      knnresult new:struct containing the second list to be merged
 *      int m: number of query points
 *      int k: int k: number of nearest neighbors we are looking for
 *      int offset: offset of the corpus sub-set points in respect to the original corpus set
 * Output:
 *      None
